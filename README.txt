I work as a data scientist for a year while I'm still a grad Computer Science student at BGU University. 
I learned and implemented ML algorithms on real world problem, but still feel that I'm lack of the core concepts in data science process.
The goal is to strengthen the basics in statistics, data preprocessing, visualization, and than move back to advance ML methods.
I want to understand why, when and how to do each step in the DS process.

In this project I'll write a Jupyter notebook on each subject.
I'll implement every subject I'll learn with code and on real datasets. This way I'll connect the theoretical  ideas to real world problems.

Each lesson will be divided into these sections:
1. "Meet Trinity" - tl;dr, what is <subject> ?
2. "Should I take the blue pill?" - Why do I need it?
3.  "Meet Morpheus" - Some theoretical background
4. "I know Kung Fu"- Hands on experience


I assume people who read this have a basic knowledge of a graduate Compute Science student.

Technical details:
I'm running the Jupyter notebook within conda environment.
I installed Anacoda with python2.7.
If I'll use a different environment, Ill note in inside the notebook.


Enjoy reading
